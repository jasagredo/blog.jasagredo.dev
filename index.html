<p>I'm a programmer. I studied Computer engineering and mathematics at
UCM (Madrid).</p>

<p>I like to play with computers, code stuff and investigate how things work. I
find myself interested in not-so-common languages, such as Prolog (I have been
solving AOC on
Prolog <a href="https://github.com/jasagredo?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=prolog&sort=)">for
a couple of years</a>) or in the past Common Lisp and Clojure. Nowadays I mostly do Haskell.</p>

<p>I'm currently working for <a href="https://iog.io/">IOE</a>. On my free time I like to
<a href="https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+is%3Aclosed">contribute</a>
to <a href="https://www.haskell.org/cabal/">cabal</a> recently doing some tweaks
for making cabal more friendly for Windows users.</p>

<p>I don't know much about Windows' internals. Until 2023 I had always worked on
Linux, but I got tired of dual booting and thus I started using Windows daily,
even for my work.<p>
